RECAP:

== VS ===
!= vs !==

=== -> both values and data types should be equal
!= -> not equal
!== -> data types and values have to be equal
== -> equal

falsy values: false, 0, null, undefined, '', NaN
|| -> 
?? -> nullish operator




if you put these two different things into console.log:
typeof - > if you are wondering what type of data you are using
variable -> if you want answer to your data


-------------------------------------------

JS Numbers: floating numbers (numbers with decimals), absolute number (whole numbers)
number: 64 bits and under
bigint: 64 bits and up



-----------
JavaScript Number Functions:

toString() - returns a number as a string
toFixed() - returns a number written with a number of decimals
toPrecision() - returns a number written witha  specified length



Converting Variable Numbers:

Number() - returns a number converted from its argument
parseFloat() - parses its argument and returns a floating number
parseInt() - parses its argument and returns a whole number




*All of these remove the integer and leave it at a whole number
ceil() - rounds to the upward integer
floor() - rounds to the downward integer
round() - rounds to the nearest integer
trunc() - returns the integer part of the number
random() - returns a random number between 0 and 1 (0 included by 1 excluded)
sqrt() -

random() generate a random number between 5 and 10 both inclusive
5, 6, 7, 8


Generate a random number between a and b
We assume a is less than b


generate random number between 123 and 267
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * (267 - 123 + 1)) + 123);
