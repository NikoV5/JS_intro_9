ES6 Features:
Backticks: String templates or string literals (``)
------------------
You can write multiple scripts in one line, however its more user friendly and nice looking if you put each line of code in there own line

Conventions: We always put one statement per line
------------------
never have odd number of backslashes in line
------------------
Variables: Special containers that store data in any programming language
30-40
let-var-const (all are used to create variables that stores a piece of data such text, numbers, or collection)

Data types 
String: text data types (name, address, phone number, special characters,ssn)
Strings are store3d in quotes (single or double quotes)

ex:
let name = 'niko';
let city = "chicago";

Number: whole (absolute) number and floating numbers (decimal points)

ex: 1,5,3000,55
    10.99, 3.5

Let price = 10.99;
let age = 27;

Naming Variables:
Syntax:
 - You cannot have spaces.
 - You cannot start with digits but use digits anywhere else.
 - You cannot use any special characters but _, $ and all other currency signs and you can use these even as the first characters
 - you cannot use any reserved keyword 
 var let const class static 
 - You cannot use a variable name twice.

 Convention:
  - We start with lowercase
  - We follow camel-case rule -> bankAccountNumber
  - We should always give meaningful names to our variables

ex: 
let country = 'USA';
let city = 'Chicago';

x, y, z, a, b, c
